[{"content":"You can check the all the laws of UX here.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve followed these practices for a while now.\nAesthetic-Usability Effect Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable.\nIt is for this reason that I tend to use Tailwind for all my projects.\nThe mobile first approach not only makes the apps responsive without much trouble (that\u0026rsquo;s the secondary benefit), it actually ensures that all the components are aesthetically pleasing to mobile users and not just a bunch of divs forced to fit into the mobile screen.\nDoherty Threshold Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (\u0026lt;400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.\nThis is the most obvious one of them all. Your APIs should (and I make this my ground rule) not take more than 500ms to respond. Beyond that, if B2C product, you might have just lost a potential customer\u0026rsquo;s attention.\nEven if you\u0026rsquo;re B2B product, sub-second APIs tend to give a better customer experience.\nThat being said, it isn\u0026rsquo;t always possible to improve API performance, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re stuck with an old framework or you have self hosted the backend.\nIn such a case, you can do these things:\nAdd an animation while they wait for the API to resolve (not a plain progress bar or spinner). Turn the API into a stream or paginate the response Add a caching layer like redis. Hick’s Law The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.\nThis basically says don\u0026rsquo;t clutter your screen.\nExamples Here is an example of it:\nGoogle Homepage The Google Homepage could have a link to any one of the plethora of application or services they have but instead, they focus on one thing only\u0026hellip; The search bar.\nYou might have seen those other search engines with news on the bottom or affiliate programs. Compared to them, Google Search just feels premium.\nThis law also somewhat ties in with Occam\u0026rsquo;s Razor\nWhen building applications, I try to eliminate any unnecessary detail that I can, and if I have to show it there\u0026hellip; maybe some use and some don\u0026rsquo;t, I usually provide a hide section button (also remembering their choices).\nThis enables them to focus only on the content that they actually need. All the action buttons are prominent but all the secondary actions can be hidden behind a dropdown menu of the page.\nPeak-End Rule People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.\nAll the D2C applications inherently do this where they focus a lot of effort on the first screen that the user interacts with, it is the point of initial perception.\nHowever B2B application by and large ignore this part altogether where they would have some really old jQuery based login page or some bootstrap template based login screen.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/using-laws-of-ux-in-my-projects/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou can check the all the laws of UX \u003ca href=\"https://lawsofux.com/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve followed these practices for a while now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"aesthetic-usability-effect\"\u003eAesthetic-Usability Effect\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsers often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt is for this reason that I tend to use \u003cstrong\u003eTailwind\u003c/strong\u003e for all my projects.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mobile first approach not only makes the apps responsive without much trouble (that\u0026rsquo;s the secondary benefit), it actually ensures that all the components are aesthetically pleasing to mobile users and not just a bunch of divs forced to fit into the mobile screen.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Using Laws of UX in My Experience"},{"content":"In the vast endless sea, my heart still beats for that one droplet.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/first-note/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn the vast endless sea, my heart still beats for that one droplet.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"First Note"}]
