You can check the all the laws of UX [here](https://lawsofux.com/).

I've followed these practices for a while now.
## 1. Aesthetic-Usability Effect
Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design thatâ€™s more usable.

*It is for this reason that I tend to use **Tailwind** for all my projects.*

The mobile first approach not only makes the apps responsive without much trouble (that's the secondary benefit), it actually ensures that all the components are aesthetically pleasing to mobile users and not just a bunch of divs forced to fit into the mobile screen.
